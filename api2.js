Otherwise, line a muffin tin with baking cups.\nMix together the coconut flour, tapioca flour, salt, xanthan gum, baking soda, and baking powder. Set aside.\nBeat the eggs, sugar, and mayonnaise until fluffy.\nThen slowly add the vanilla, flour mixture, and milk. Alternating between the flour and milk to make a nice fluffy cake. Note- I usually use just barely under 3/4 C of the milk alternative.\nPour the batter into the greased cake pans or fill the baking cups 3/4 full (makes 24 cupcakes).\nBake for 20-25 minutes for the cakes or 12-15 minutes for the cupcakes. Cakes are done when they are nicely browned and spring back when lightly touched or when a toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Let cool completely before icing.\nFor The Icing:\nBring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Place a heatproof bowl over the saucepan (make sure the water isnt touching the bottom) and add the chocolate and butter.\nStir until melted. Then, add the remaining ingredients.\nPlace uncovered in freezer for 15 minutes.\nBeat with hand mixer until light and fluffy. If its too runny, place back in freezer a few minutes and repeat process until the icing is a good consistency.",
